Design Patterns Explained with Fabbles
=====================================

> Ultra-simplified explanation to design patterns with with fabbles

Design patterns - A topic that can make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make them stick into your mind by explaining them using easy to understand fabbles.

Lets begin with the simple definition

> Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems

Having said that; they are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations. A few things to keep in mind include:

- They are not a silver bullet to all your problems. You should not try to force them.
- Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems, not solution **finding** problem
- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else it can result in a horrible mess of a code.
