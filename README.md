Design Patterns Explained with Fables
=====================================
> Ultra-simplified explanation to design patterns!

Design patterns is something that can easily make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make them stick in to your (and maybe mine?!) mind by explaining them in the *simplest* way possible.

Design Patterns
===============
In plain words
> Solutions to recurring problems. Guidelines on how to tackle certain problems.
 
Wikipedia Says
> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.  

They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations. 

> - They are not a silver bullet to all your problems. You should not try to force them.
> - Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems, not solution **finding** problem
> - If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else it can result in a horrible mess of a code.

Creational Design Patterns
==========================
In plain words
> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
